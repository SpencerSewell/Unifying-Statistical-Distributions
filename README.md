# Unifying-Statistical-Distributions
In statistics there appear to be four major sources for probability distributions, although the list is not limited to this: “the uniform distributions, either discrete Uniform(n), or continuous Uniform(a, b), those that come from the Bernoulli process or sampling with or without replacement: Bernoulli(p), Binomial(n, p), Geometric(p), NegativeBinomial(p, r), and Hypergeometric(N, M, n). those that come from the Poisson process: Poisson(λ, t), Exponential(λ), Gamma(λ, r), and Beta(α, β), [and] those related to the Central Limit Theorem: Normal(µ, σ2 ), ChiSquared(ν), T(ν), and F(ν1, ν2).” (Joyce, 2006).  If you explore the distributions further, connections between these various distributions can be made, both defined on a discrete and continuous basis. In this undergraduate study, we will define what a probability distribution is, and then explore the various types of distributions in both a discrete and continuous case. Then, through a thorough examination of both types of models, we will uncover the similarities and differences between them.
